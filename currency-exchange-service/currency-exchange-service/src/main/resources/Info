Ribbon : used for load balancing, if we are making api call to other service , then we can make call to only one instance directly
	we might hard coded that url in feign client. 
	If we use Ribbon, we can make calls to any instance depending on load
	Configuring Ribbon :
		Dependency in pom.xml (conversion service)
		Enable Ribbon client in proxy class - @RibbonClient(name = "currency-exchange-service")
		Remove hardcodedurl in feignclient annotation - @FeignClient(name = "currency-exchange-service",url = "localhost:8000")
		Configure in application.properties



using zuul API gateway
to make calls : http://localhost:8765/{appl name}/uri
